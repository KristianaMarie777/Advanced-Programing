LOOKAT
KITCHEN
Why would you look at the Kitchen Entrance?
FIRST_FLOOR_BATHROOM 
Why would you look at the washroom Entrance?
PHOTO
Looking at the photos on the wall you get the sudden feeling to check the backs of the photos.
Behind one of the photos you find a note.
It reads "password is CATTHEYISHERE".
Where would I need a password?
END
BASEMENT
The door is locked. There might be a key somewhere.
END
STAIRS
These stairs lead to the first floor... Or was it third....
Top floor sounds nicer easier.
END
WORKROOM
Why would you look at the workroom Entrance?
END
WINDOW
This window is really easy to break. But, breaking it will alert the neighbours.
Going to jail is not my priority right now.
END
COUCH
There are usually treasures on the couch...
When I say treasures I mean Trash.
END
BROKEN_TV
This tv is very heavy. But I can handle it.
Just don't take it with me to another room.
END
SHELVES
There is nothing there.
END
DRAWERS
There is nothing there.

First Floor Washroom
N
There is nothing really to note inside the washroom besides the fact all doors have Locks.
What is with the design of this washroom!
Why does it have three doors that go into it?
Terrible design.

Work Room
N
There is a desk with a COMPUTER on it.
END
E
The wall is nicely decorated. I guess itâ€™s because there are no windows in here.
Without any windows it kinda makes it look like a storage room.
Nothing much to note.
END
S
Just a wall. Nothing much to note.
END
W
Just the door to the LIVINGROOM and FIRST_FLOOR_BATHROOM.
