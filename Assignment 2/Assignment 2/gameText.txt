PHOTO

Looking at the photos on the wall you get the sudden feeling to check the backs of the photos.
Behind one of the photos you find a note.
-
It reads "password is CATTHEYISHERE".
-
-
"Where would I need a password?"

END
BASEMENT

The door is locked...
-
"There might be a key somewhere. Why would the owner not have a key basement?...
-
I guess if they lost it....
-
Let's hope that's not the case."

END
STAIRS

These stairs lead to the first floor... Or was it third....
-
I'll call it first. Sounds nicer easier. <inner conscious confused>

END
WORKROOM

Why would you look at the workroom Entrance?
Just go in!

END
WINDOW

This window is really easy to break. But, breaking it will alert the neighbours.
Going to jail is not my priority right now.

END
COUCH

There are usually treasures on the couch...
When I say treasures I mean Trash.

END
BROKEN_TV

This tv is very heavy. But I can handle it.
Just don't take it with me to another room.

END
SHELVES

There is nothing there. Except for a lonely red cup.

END
DRAWERS

There is nothing there. Except for a bunch of trash.

END

The wall is nicely decorated. I guess itâ€™s because there are no windows in here.
Without any windows it kinda makes it look like a storage room.
Nothing much to note.

CATTHEYISHERE

The computer opened up.
After reading for a while you find some very important information.
You find out that the key to the basement is in the SAFE in the BEDROOM.
"Why place it in there? There could be something valuable in the BASEMENT."
-
You continue to read...
-
The code to the SAFE is the colours of the cups in the house.
There is not specific order just PRESS the coloured buttons.
