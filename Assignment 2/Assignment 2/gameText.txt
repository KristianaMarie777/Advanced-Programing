HOW TO PLAY

You need to words inorder to play the game
The first word is a command while the second word is an action or interactable item.

Here is a list of commands

TURN - turns the player LEFT, or RIGHT.
TYPE - allows you to type something on a COMPUTER.
LOOKAT - allows you to that a closer look at items.
DODGE - allows you to dodge attacks by moving LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. (Only available during fight scene)
PRESS - allows you to PRESS a bunch of buttons on a SAFE.
GET - allows you to pick up items. Does not work for ever item.
USE - allows you to USE 2 "items" together. For example, USE KEY_ON_BASEMENT. _ON_ is necessary when using this command to seperate the two items.
WALKTO/GOTO - allows to walk into new rooms.
SEE - allows you to see a objective list or saves your game. Type "SEE TODO" to see the list and "USE SAVE" to save the game.


If you see text that are fully capitalized like THIS it is an intractable iteam.

Good luck!
